Hey there! This is a cool Python script that lets you convert images into ASCII art. To get started, follow these steps:

Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.
Clone this repository to your computer.
Install the required dependencies by running this command: pip install Pillow
Run the script by typing python image_to_ascii.py in the terminal.
Choose an image file when prompted and the script will convert it to ASCII art and save it to a text file named "output_text.txt" in the same directory as the script.
You can modify the ASCII characters used for drawing by changing the ascii_chars list in the script to your liking.
Have fun with your newly generated ASCII art!
This script also comes with a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter that allows you to easily select an image file and save the resulting ASCII art to a text file.
