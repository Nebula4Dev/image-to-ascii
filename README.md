Hey there! This is a cool Python script that lets you convert images into ASCII art. To get started, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.
2. Clone this repository to your computer.
3. Install the required dependencies by running this command: `pip install Pillow`
4. Run the script by typing `python image_to_ascii.py` in the terminal.
5. Choose an image file when prompted and the script will convert it to ASCII art and save it to a text file named "output_text.txt" in the same directory as the script.
6. You can modify the ASCII characters used for drawing by changing the `ascii_chars` list in the script to your liking.
7. Have fun with your newly generated ASCII art!

This script also comes with a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter that allows you to easily select an image file and save the resulting ASCII art to a text file.
