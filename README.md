Hey there! This is a cool Python script that can convert images to ASCII art. You can use it to create some fun and unique art pieces. Here's how you can use it:

First, make sure you have Python installed on your computer.
Then, go ahead and clone the repository to your local machine.
Next, you'll need to install the Pillow library by running this command: pip install Pillow.
To run the script, simply type python image_to_ascii.py in your command line.
The script will prompt you to choose an image file to convert to ASCII art. Once you select an image file, it will convert it and save the output to a text file named "output_text.txt".
If you want to customize the ASCII characters used in the art, you can modify the ascii_chars list in the script.
Have fun exploring and creating ASCII art!
The script also comes with a user-friendly graphical interface that you can use to choose an image file and save the output as a text file.
